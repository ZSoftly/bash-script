  We are are going to be creating bash scripts to automate
  Regular Boring Tasks in the bash terminal

### african-countries
This program is to display the Official Language of all the countries in Africa base on user input

### read.sh
  This scripts uses read, which is  bash function
  It prompts the user for input at runtime
  stores the value of the variable and displays it to the terminal

### file.sh
  Call on this script to check if a file exists and if the current user
  Has execute permissions on the file
  If the input data is not a file it current directory, you will get a so response
  
### exec.sh
  This script is use to start and enter a container base on user input.
  The sript will first disply the name and state of the container,
  Then start the container if it is in an "Exited" state and Log in to it
  Or Log in to it if it's already "Up and running"
